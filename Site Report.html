        My current involvement in Web development during my studies at university has been a time of pure emotion. It has included a flurry of mixed emotions that include enjoyment and stress. My time has been spent diving deep into the key thematic of web development such as: The necessity of using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs); Looking at web pages; using web technologies; the inclusion of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to structure web pages and implementing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Learning and implementing these factors into my daily educational routine has given me the necessary foundations to be able to embark on this Long and invigorating journey of web development. With this extensive foundation I have successfully designed and developed my very own portfolio website.
    </p>
    <p2>
        The website consists of four main pages: a home page portfolio page and a blog page. The main colour schemes throughout the website are black and silver this is to create an effect of professionalism for the viewer and the colour green for the navbar headings is to display a more homely and comforting effect, furthermore the use of hover effects and transitions allows the headings to transition from green to white. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The portfolio pages have a more unique dynamic and the main colures are silver and black so to maintain the professionalism effect and the implementation of keyframe movement enables the body to move in a compelling motion. A similar green colour transitioning to white was also implemented to maintain consistency and effect.
    </p3>
    <p>
        The contact page though seemingly simpler the other pages which the colour scheme of black and white still maintains the effect of professionalism while the navigation bar still maintains its normal green heading that transition to white when hovered over. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, the Blog page the main colour schemes are white Gray and sliver so to ensure the professionalism is maintained. The blog posts have been placed above various empty tabs to allow updating and a more convenient space for comments. The layered list like design was implemented for easier readability of the views.
    </p>
    <p>
        The entire web site is responsive to all devices as well
